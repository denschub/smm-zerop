/// A wrapper around a [minijinja::Environment]. This is meant to be added to
/// [crate::components::app_state::AppState] inside an [Arc], so it's available
/// for requests. Each request should then call [Self::acquire_env] to acquire
/// its personalized copy of the minijinja Environment.
///
/// Calling this will always give you a clone of an internal base environment.
/// This might sound like an odd thing to do, but it has a purpose.
///
/// In Development, the [minijinja::path_loader] caches the compiled templates
/// in the environment itself. So if we were to re-use that for all requests,
/// we'd have to restart the app to apply template changes. If we throw away the
/// Environment after every request, we get magical live template reloading,
/// which just is a nice bit of DevEx.
///
/// In Release builds, this uses a mechanism that is _similar_ to the one
/// provided by `minijinja_embed`, but not quite. The upstream implementation
/// immediately calls `env.add_template` on every template, and then stores the
/// compiled results in the Environment. This is nice for for pure performance,
/// as each template only needs to be compiled once, but there's a not
/// insignificant memory cost to each template, that will just stick around
/// forever. This implementation also does statically embed the template strings
/// into the binary, but it doesn't `add_template` them, it just stores the
/// template strings in a `HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>`. A custom loader
/// is used to then compile those for each environment. This is, technically,
/// less efficient - but template compilation is not a real cost. In a local
/// benchmark with a fairly typical template (layout with two blocks, a partial,
/// and a few simple ifs), it added around 50µs to each response. If I ever get
/// into a point where the difference matters, this is easily reverted for that
/// project. Most of the time, I don't care.
