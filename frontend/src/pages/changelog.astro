    <h2>2024-10-12</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You'll now be able to see each level's theme and its clear condition - if there is one.</li>
      <li>
        You can now filter for Level Themes and Tags. So if you want to hunt those juicy Ghost House speedruns, this is
        your chance!
      </li>
      <li>
        In addition, you can also filter for Clear Conditions now! Because there are so many, they are grouped into
        logical groups, but you'll be able to find what you're looking for. And before anyone asks: yes, Yoshi is a
        power-up.

      <li>
        It is now possible to select "Any" for the year, too. This allows you to randomize across all available years if
        you want to. Note, however, that the default selection will stay on the current focus year.

        to the project's Discord!

        We're almost done with all 2020 SMM2 levels! This randomizer now also supports levels from 2021 and 2022. The
        default selection will remain with 2020 until everything is cleared.

    <h2>2024-03-13</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removed the outdated data alert again, as the data should no longer lag super badly. We'll keep working on
        making it even better in the future!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2023-11-09</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can now click on a Course ID to copy it to your clipboard. Useful if you want to paste it into Discord, a
        text editor, or anywhere else, really.
      </li>
      <li>
        There was a rare edge-case in the component that imported the level database, which resulted in the database
        being completely empty for a couple of minutes. According to the logs, not a single user was affected by this -
        but this fixed now either way.
