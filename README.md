# smm-zerop

This repo contains both the frontend and the backend for the Team 0% dashboard at [`smm-zerop.0b101010.services`](https://smm-zerop.0b101010.services/). Please check [the tools' public about page](https://smm-zerop.0b101010.services/about/) for details about what this is about.

- `backend/` contains all the backend portions, including the API server and the data importer. It's a Rust application, using axum and sqlx.
- `frontend/` contains the UI. The frame is based on Astro, using React components inserted via Astro Islands. Data loading is handled via TanStack Query.

## Development and Deployment

Sorry, this part of the documentation is a bit [ToDo] at the moment, I'll follow up soon.
